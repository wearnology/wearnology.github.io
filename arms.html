		<h2>WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY: SKIN TRACK CONVERTS YOUR ARM INTO A TOUCHSCREEN</h2>
		<img src="amiges/arm 1.jpg">
		<P>In the last few years, wearable technology has come a long way, wherein developments in the field of smartwatches are quite notable. In a recent development, researchers at the Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania have come up with an innovative technology called Skin Track which helps in converting your arm or your skin in touchscreen,  in order to operate a smartwatch worn by you.</P>
		
		<h2>Wearable Tech coming to a sleeve or softgood near you, with more information than ever</h2>
		<img src="amiges/arm 2.webp">
		<P>Ever since heart rate monitors became mainstream over 20 years ago, there hasn’t really been any sort of advancement in live biofeedback until recently. Aside from how the information is transmitted, we still strap on a HR monitor to measure the same ol’ heartrate. Sometimes that’s on your wrist now, but mostly still the standard chest strap. But with all the new sensors telling us what we’re doing with the bike, wouldn’t it be nice to know a little more about what your doing with your body?
