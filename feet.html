	<p>Whether you’re an experienced or beginner runner, tracking how fast you run and your heart rate can be helpful to reaching fitness goals or training for races. Smartwatches like those by Apple, FitBit and Garmin collect some metrics, as do running or health-related apps. However, there’s another way: NURVV Run smart running insoles offer an alternative to wrist or app-based trackers. After you slip the insoles into your sneakers, NURVV calculates detailed insights about your runs through sensors right on your feet. The insoles measure everything from cadence to pronation, and share feedback across your runs in companion iOS or Android apps. And you can easily take the insoles in and out of your shoes, allowing you to use them across multiple different pairs of sneakers. NURVV is not the only brand to think this way — brands like Under Armour installed sensors into the sneakers themselves, pairing with apps reporting similar metrics as NURVV’s.</p>
