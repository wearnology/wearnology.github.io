	<h3>This dissertation is an investigation into wearable technology. The aim is to discover why its adoption has been slow to
date, if its adoption is likely to speed up, and what steps can be taken to aid its adoption by consumers. Through a
literature review and interviews with consumers, evidence has been gathered that suggests that it's just a matter of time
until wearables are widely adopted. However there are still improvements in design, which have been identified, that
could be made to ease this adoption of wearable technology.<h3>
